React Router DOM: Navigation in React Applications

Welcome to React Router DOM! Today we'll learn how to add navigation and multiple pages to your React applications. Just like how Zerodha has different sections (Dashboard, Orders, Portfolio) that you can navigate between, you'll learn to create multi-page React apps.

ü§î Part 1: Why Do We Need Routing?

The Problem with Single Page Applications (SPAs)
By default, React creates Single Page Applications - everything happens on one page. But real applications need multiple views:


// Without Router - Everything in one component (BAD!)
function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <Header />
            <Dashboard />      {/* Always shows dashboard */}
            <Orders />         {/* Always shows orders */}
            <Portfolio />      {/* Always shows portfolio */}
            <Settings />       {/* Always shows settings */}
        </div>
    );
}


Real-World Example: Zerodha Navigation

When you use Zerodha:

- `/dashboard` ‚Üí Shows trading dashboard
- `/orders` ‚Üí Shows your orders
- `/portfolio` ‚Üí Shows your holdings
- `/profile` ‚Üí Shows account settings

Each URL shows different content but it's still the same React app!

What We Want to Achieve

// With Router - Show different components based on URL (GOOD!)
function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <Header />
            {/* URL: /dashboard ‚Üí Show Dashboard */}
            {/* URL: /orders ‚Üí Show Orders */}
            {/* URL: /portfolio ‚Üí Show Portfolio */}
        </div>
    );
}

üöÄ Part 2: What is React Router DOM?

Simple Definition
React Router DOM is a library that adds navigation capabilities to React applications. It allows you to:
- Show different components based on the URL
- Navigate between pages without page refresh
- Handle browser back/forward buttons
- Share specific page URLs

Key Benefits
1. URL-based Navigation: Each page has its own URL
2. Browser History: Back/forward buttons work correctly
3. Bookmarkable Pages: Users can bookmark specific pages
4. SEO Friendly: Search engines can index different pages
5. Professional Feel: Works like traditional websites

üì¶ Part 3: Installation and Setup

Step 1: Install React Router DOM

Using npm
npm install react-router-dom

Using yarn
yarn add react-router-dom


Step 2: Basic Setup Structure

// index.js or App.js
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
    return (
        <BrowserRouter>
            {/* Your app components go here */}
        </BrowserRouter>
    );
}


Important: `BrowserRouter` must wrap your entire application!

üß≠ Part 4: Core Routing Concepts

1. Routes and Route
Think of Routes like a traffic controller that decides which component to show:


import { Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
    return (
        <BrowserRouter>
            <Routes>
                <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
                <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
                <Route path="/contact" element={<Contact />} />
            </Routes>
        </BrowserRouter>
    );
}


2. Link Component

Use `Link` instead of `<a>` tags for navigation:


import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

function Navigation() {
    return (
        <nav>
            <Link to="/">Home</Link>
            <Link to="/about">About</Link>
            <Link to="/contact">Contact</Link>
        </nav>
    );
}


Why Link instead of `<a>`?

- `<a>` refreshes the entire page (slow)
- `<Link>` updates only the content (fast)

3. useNavigate Hook

For programmatic navigation (like after form submission):


import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

function LoginForm() {
    const navigate = useNavigate();
    
    const handleLogin = () => {
        // After successful login
        navigate('/dashboard');
    };
    
    return (
        <button onClick={handleLogin}>Login</button>
    );
}

üé® Part 6: Navigation UI Patterns

1. Active Link Styling

import { NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';

function Navigation() {
    return (
        <nav>
            <NavLink 
                to="/dashboard" 
                className={({ isActive }) => isActive ? 'active-link' : 'nav-link'}
            >
                Dashboard
            </NavLink>
        </nav>
    );
}


2. Conditional Navigation

function Header() {
    const location = useLocation();
    
    return (
        <header>
            <h1>Trading App</h1>
            {location.pathname !== '/login' && <Navigation />}
        </header>
    );
}

üìö ASSIGNMENT: Add Routing to Your Zerodha Trading Dashboard

üéØ Your Mission
Transform your existing Zerodha-style dashboard into a multi-page application using React Router DOM. Create separate pages for different trading sections just like the real Zerodha platform.

üìã What You Need to Build

Required Pages (5 Different Routes)
1. Dashboard (`/`) - Main trading interface
2. Orders (`/orders`) - Order management page
3. Holdings (`/holdings`) - Portfolio holdings view
4. Positions (`/positions`) - Current positions page
5. Funds (`/funds`) - Account funds management

Navigation Requirements
- Header Navigation: Links to all main sections
- Active States: Highlight current page in navigation
- Responsive: Works on desktop and mobile
- Professional: Matches Zerodha's navigation style

üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Implementation

Phase 1: Setup Routing (1 hour)
1. Install React Router DOM in your existing project
2. Wrap your App with BrowserRouter
3. Create basic Routes structure with placeholder components
4. Test navigation between pages

Phase 2: Create Page Components (2 hours)
5. Dashboard Page: Move your existing dashboard components here
6. Orders Page: Create dedicated orders management interface
7. Holdings Page: Build portfolio holdings display
8. Positions Page: Show current trading positions
9. Funds Page: Design account balance and funds transfer

Phase 3: Navigation & Polish (1-2 hours)
10. Header Navigation: Add Link components for all pages
11. Active States: Implement NavLink with active styling
12. Breadcrumbs: Add navigation breadcrumbs where appropriate
13. 404 Page: Handle invalid routes

üéØ Page-Specific Requirements

Dashboard Page (`/`)
- Your existing trading dashboard layout
- Watchlist, chart, and quick actions
- Market overview and account summary

Orders Page (`/orders`)
- Order history table with filters
- Pending, executed, and cancelled orders
- Order placement form
- Order status indicators

Holdings Page (`/holdings`)
- Complete portfolio overview
- Stock-wise holdings with P&L
- Performance charts and metrics
- Buy/sell action buttons

Positions Page (`/positions`)
- Current intraday positions
- Realized and unrealized P&L
- Position sizing and risk metrics
- Square-off functionality

Funds Page (`/funds`)
- Account balance display
- Add funds interface
- Withdrawal requests
- Transaction history

üí° Implementation Hints

Basic Router Setup

// App.js structure hint
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
    return (
        <BrowserRouter>
            <Header />  {/* Navigation stays on all pages */}
            <Routes>
                {/* Define your routes here */}
            </Routes>
            <Footer />  {/* Footer stays on all pages */}
        </BrowserRouter>
    );
}


Navigation Component Pattern

// Header.js navigation hint
import { Link, useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';

function Header() {
    const location = useLocation();
    
    return (
        <header>
            <nav>
                {/* Create navigation links */}
            </nav>
        </header>
    );
}
